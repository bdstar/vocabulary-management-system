my name is Richardson and I happen to have been born in Britain all peoples have their peculiarities in their enthusiasms we are no exception one of our enthusiasms is a game whose cause is served by experts and by those who only stand and wait and while they wait certain preparations solemnly proceeding during many hours reach their climax well this is lords deeply rooted in tradition and in the ritual tradition brings wear until the proper time no man may enter unless he have some special access well on this occasion I have some special access my names are lat John our late' and later on I'll be telling you something about the match in the meantime out comes the old country line measure 22 yards for rods poles or perches one chain the length of a cricket pitch they're measuring out the wicket and that is something of a ritual as a matter of fact it takes many hours of skillful work over many months to prepare a first-class wicket and that's just what this is the special test wicket a very revered touch of English turf plumbing line with the pavilion door the test wicket of old Test wickets when at Nords England plays Australia when that happens everything has to be just so to start with anyway and well they've been working the crowds of being gathering soon to grow to something like 30,000 people to say nothing of those who have to stay at home and listen on the radio to people like me 30,000 people and many millions throughout the world did but time and geography allowed this game called cricket had its origin in quiet places and lives on in equally quiet places deep in the hearts of those who love it what is it about this unobtrusive game what is its magic for magic it must surely be that makes men sit and watch and dream of past occasions and of wistful yearnings never quite fulfilled magic it is that makes the hush when captains meet the wicket is inspected and another test begins Don Bradman wins the toss for Australia and Australia are going to bat they're going to get first use of this good wicked and here's the England side coming into the field Yardley leading woman here Tom dollar a Jim Laker Denis Compton and Douglas right of Kent at the end and then I to the pavilion gate come Australia's opening pair bonds and Morris Morris in the cap an Alec peddler of sorry begins the bowling from the nursery end fast medium right arm comes in bowls to bonds outside the off stump and it bounces off Evans pads bed sir again both again to barns and again beats him outside the off stump and the first overs a quiet one a maid and Alec Coxon of Yorkshire Bulls the second over from the pavilion elbows well out comes in bows to Morris Morris forced him away on the onside and the Australian innings is underway the first runs up on the board and so another historic test is underway watched by the press of half the world watch to by appraising eyes in the pavilion eyes that have seen many a cricketer come and go for here in the long room at Lord's criticism is restrained praise is brief and only sunny days and the history are long here are pictures that have captured in eternal attitudes the beginnings of the game showing the essence of this thing called cricket all Fortin spirit concentrated on a square of green subtle battle between a slice of willow and a round of leather days of to stump wickets when bets were curved and the scorer kept the tally with notches on a stick paintings of village greens in days when cockfighting was rife pictures of the High Noon of Victorian peace when cricket had become part of English education and Lords itself in 1837 they rented a they acknowledged home of cricket Australia's eating's has come to a close the score stands high and is duly noted that it's time to breathe until England takes the field now cricket in the hands of the experts more than a game it's a craft at least almost a science let's ask an expert Bert Rhodes of Derbyshire the bonus a late break on this demonstration wicked now there's the spinning finger the third one see coddled close against the same he comes up now this is the perfect leg break watch where it pitches just outside the line of the leg stump and it turns enough to beat the off stump and now the Orthodox the natural breaks spun off that index finger the off break and this pitch is what it outside the line of the off stump and it beats the leg stump now that's the right arm bowlers Orthodox weapon let's see how the batsman copes with it as the ball comes down to him turning into him but all right he just lets it hit the bed that's why short leg fields when were born well perhaps attacks the best method of defense then comes an off break again and the batsman hooks it hard and high over those short leg fields Minh but not over deep square leg there is a way of doing it of course over the ball as it moves into you and push it away along the ground as edge rich does this ball from Linville playing it to barns when England earned 27 for 1 which is nothing for Englishmen to be very happy about and rail in ball is bowling at full speed to Hutton that balls well up Germany pushes it away past mid off for a comfortable 2 Bradman moves round those hungry Australian strip fields Minh and Linville in one of the finest spells of fast bowling seen in England since la would Bulls again this time to aid rich and Ed rich pushes him away out into the covers quite safely while experts battle experts Forge the weapons that they use good fight willow with a wholesome heart long seasons like the manor who shape it skilled hands practicing a long-established craft for wasn't John small the cobbler making cricket balls at Hambledon 200 years ago since then the craft has grown and yet there still remains the steadiness of eye and hand that sews the seeds seems that in the bolas hands will give the hidden feel for breaks and twists seems to withstand the onslaught of the bat for the heart of a bat is firm till its blows have strength and punch yes it got punch all right power it doesn't get there by accident take the handle now it's cane and rubber springing to wit because it's got to when a Hut nura bradman drives a fast bowler far away there's got to be good splicing for that kind of thing too but cricket and craftsmanship go hand in hand and when handle meets blade in a cricket bat you've got a real piece of craftsmanship it's the same with a ball sewn firm and tight and when it's done a durable balanced projectile carefully weighed and measured and graded as precise in its making as the hands that will use it as precise as precise as a cricket bat first-class weapons one designed to break or swing and beat the bat and the other to fathom the tricks of the bowler and send the ball far away and it takes doug writer number 11 with a wild swing over the boners head sky high up there into the long field to save England from the follow-on and raelynne will with four wickets already in the match Bulls again from the pavilion end and bowls Alec Benson an England are all out for 215 135 behind Australia on the first innings only some long faces in the printing room at this news there's quite an organisation down there they keep abreast with the play recording of fall of each wicket and the scores so that late arrivals can pick up the score in detail straight away as they come in of Australia 135 in front they'll probably think that's a pretty sad three pennyworth but now Australian started their second innings bed sir both the bonds his inswinger and bonds puts it away down to long leg Ron comes Hutton building at long leg and there's that quick low throw to Godfrey Evans and now right Bulls to Morris and he's out when a wicked Falls or hit is made those behind the scenes spring into action what dear accord we'll go speeding over land and ocean when a batsman strikes the whole world outside will want to know the score and when they knew it they'll cast an envious thought who those who set at Lord's and watch and there goes Barnes magnificently caught by wash profit low on for a hundred and forty one an Australian Oh 431 in front and now here comes Lindsay has it the vice-captain to face after Norman Yardley I suppose waiting for the earlier batsman he's had his pads on for best part of four hours well he we keep him on any longer meanwhile the Don bats on Don Bradman on his last test tour and playing his last Test innings of Lords Don Bradman the pride of Australia and the disk area but whichever side one favours who can but a cleaner master Bradlee whose name now joins the golden pageant and it is a golden pageant let's look at just a few of them silver Billy beldam of Hambledon who in the 1780s became the first great batsman william lily-white the nonpareil the man who changed bowling from underarm to round arm william clark the one-eyed nottingham bricklayer who with his old england 11 spread the gospel of cricket all through the country the Lion of Kent Alfred men a great fast bowler of the 1840s and 50s Spofford the demon bowler from Australia who in the great test of 1882 even took the wicked of the old man WG Grace the Gloucestershire country doctor who turned a rustic sport into the science of modern cricket the first man to score a century before lunch in a test Victor Trumper ran G and the bowler who suspended the laws of timing more estate Tory Grimm it the most accurate of all leg break bowlers of problem even for England's great opening pair Jack Hobbs of Surrey and his imperturbable Yorkshire partner Herbert's active Jack Hobbs the modern master who in the 1930s resigned his supremacy to a young man from Bower Oh Donald George bradman a pageant of a hundred and seventy years of cricketers on whom the Sun always shines in retrospect anyway but cricket casts its own peculiar glow and in the years to come this day two of rain and cloud will be sunlit in the memory will rain stop play anxious eyes survey the wicket willing a hands turn to but fate is kind and the battle is renewed all through a cloudy afternoon they struggle on the English batsmen extra-careful heavily conscious of each wicket has a poor England won 596 to wane and Hutton's out out for 13 in England 42 for one wicked and now tauscheck bows to head rich Ian Johnson catches him at first slick head rich is out England 52 for 2 wickets and in trouble that'll hurry oh man depress him in the printing room well with two wickets gone for 52 England are in a lot of trouble indeed almost everything depends on the man who now comes out of the pavilion Denis Compton and with Hutton gone England's last real help so they fight on a battle of muscle senior and I well this is cricket at its finest calling forth equality deep in men but calmness of a Compton on a sticky wicket when the world is watching steadiness of nerve and quick agility to be our Hobbs a Sutcliffe a bradman or a compton the heroes changed with the years but the dream to be a cricketer lives on in every generation and the hero's pass on their knowledge for cricket is a part of the very substance of a country's education but the game knows no class and indeed no frontier in the West Indies Australia New Zealand India under the shadow of Table Mountain developing the same qualities in man regardless of background color or creed England a hundred and six for 3-1 an impossible 492 way impossible of Compton's still there and here's big Bill Johnson with that bucking bridling run coming into Bowl to him sometimes I England's last hope of the impossible and now taschek bowls the and toshack thinks he's out umpire thinks he's out Dobson consists of shame now it's all over bar shouting the day wears on another game is lost and one well the heads not quite defeat has come to England and to Australia victory Australia takes the ashes but victory is the least that men play cricket for they play it for a host of reasons it will define than hard to see on school ground on city streets on village green they play off for the urge Wells deep from quiet places in Maine and in the land they spring from
